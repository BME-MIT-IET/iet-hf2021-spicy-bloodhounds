# Cocoa bot

Cocoa is a Discord bot to schedule "coffee-breaks" for server members. You can use it just to chat with anyone that is interested to spend some time in a virtual "coffe-break" or to ask for help for a specific question and other types of meetings. The meetings are created with random people that are interested in the same goal for the meetings.


### CI and static techniques
- [ ] Running a static analysis tool and reviewing the reported problems (SonarQube, FindBugs, VS Code Analyzer, Codacy, Coverity Scan...). As static analysis tools could find numerous problems, it is enough to review only a subset of them. If the team agrees with the reported problem, it can fix some of them. Try to review different types of problem and concentrate on more complex ones (e.g. not just formatting errors).

- [ ] Supporting deployment (Docker, Vagrant...)


### Testing

- [ ] Creating or extending unit tests (xUnit...)
- [ ] Designing, executing and documenting manual tests
